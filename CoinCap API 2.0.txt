CoinCap API 2.0
v2.0.1

CoinCap is a useful tool for real-time pricing and market activity for over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. By collecting exchange data from thousands of markets, we are able to offer transparent and accurate data on asset price and availability.

Our API will offer insight into exactly which exchanges and markets contribute to our pricing.

For all endpoints, a single page offers 100 responses by default and supports up to 2,000 responses per page upon requests.
